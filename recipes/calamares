<li>750g small cleaned calamari hoods</li>
<li>1 cup plain flour</li>
<li>olive oil for deep frying</li>
<li>4 cups fresh white breadcrumbs</li>
<li>3 eggs</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>

<li>Coat calamari rings in flour, a few at a time. Dip into egg mixture then coat in breadcrumbs. Press breadcrumbs on with fingertips. Place onto a lined baking tray.</li>
