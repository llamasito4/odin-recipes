<h3>Omelette filled with potatoes</h3> 
<p>Make an omelette inspired by the Catalonian way, a classic dish made simple with only five ingredients</p>
<h3>Ingridients</h3>
<ul>
<li>500g potatoes</li>
<li>1 white onion</li>
<li>150ml olive oil</li>
<li>3 tbsp chopped flat-leaf parsley</li>
<li>6 eggs</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
<li>Scrape the new potatoes or leave the skins on, if you prefer. Cut them into thick slices. Chop the onion.</li>
<li>Heat the extra-virgin olive oil in a large frying pan, add the potatoes and onion and stew gently, partially covered, for 30 mins, stirring occasionally until the potatoes are softened. Strain the potatoes and onion through a colander into a large bowl (set the strained oil aside).</li>
<li>Beat the eggs separately, then stir into the potatoes with the parsley and plenty of salt and pepper. Heat a little of the strained oil in a smaller pan.</li>
<li>Tip everything into the pan and cook on a moderate heat, using a spatula to shape the omelette into a cushion.</li>
<li>When almost set, invert on a plate and slide back into the pan and cook a few more minutes.</li>
<li>Invert twice more, cooking the omelette briefly each time and pressing the edges to keep the cushion shape. Slide on to a plate and cool for 10 mins before serving.</li>
